# ImageClassifier-Udacity
- The project is broken down into multiple steps:
  - Load and preprocess the image dataset
  - Train the image classifier on your dataset
  - Use the trained classifier to predict image content
- I'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images.
- Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application.
### Note
[Here](https://github.com/Ragdha-Elgaidi/Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds) I make a Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds ,but don't make image classifier , Udacity gived me it .
